## Impressions
Well I saw Avatar: The Way of water the other day, I have to say this movie was one of the best visual experiences I have had.

The very essence of this post is to convey the emotions I felt. 

```python
print('Testament to the movie!')
```

### Some Photos I generated using OpenAI's Dalle!
